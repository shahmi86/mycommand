#How to see what iptables list

iptables -L

#Where does iptables is saved

/etc/iptables/rules.v4    (for ipv4)
/etc/iptables/rules.v6    (for ipv6)

#How to save current iptables

iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

#How to restore the iptables from file
##Overwrite the current rules
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

##Add the new rules keeping the current ones
iptables-restore -n < /etc/iptables/rules.v4


##Automated the above process which takes over the loading of the saved rules by installing additional package

apt-get install iptables-persistent
